# Contribution & Governance

> **Version**: 0.1 (Phase 0 — Spec & Design)
> **Status**: Draft
> **Last Updated**: 2026-03-02
> **Depends on**: All other spec documents

## 1. Repository Ownership

Each top-level directory has a designated owner responsible for code review and architectural decisions.

| Directory | Owner | Responsibility |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| `cli/` | CLI Team | CLI commands, TypeScript build, UX |
| `api_gateway/` | Platform Team | FastAPI routes, auth, WebSocket handlers |
| `orchestrator/` | Platform Team | Temporal workflows, agent scheduling |
| `twin_core/` | Platform Team | Neo4j graph engine, versioning, constraints |
| `skill_registry/` | Platform Team | Registry, loader, schema validation |
| `domain_agents/` | Agent Team | Agent implementations, domain skills |
| `mcp_core/` | Platform Team | MCP client, wire protocol |
| `tool_registry/` | Platform Team | Tool catalog, execution engine, adapters |
| `ide_assistants/` | IDE Team | VS Code, KiCad, FreeCAD extensions |
| `tests/` | All Teams | Cross-cutting tests (unit, integration, e2e) |
| `docs/` | All Teams | Specifications, guides |

## 2. Branching Strategy

### Branch Naming

| Pattern | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `main` | Stable, reviewed code only | — |
| `feat/<issue-id>/<short-desc>` | New features | `feat/met-8/mechanical-agent` |
| `fix/<issue-id>/<short-desc>` | Bug fixes | `fix/met-42/twin-merge-conflict` |
| `met-<id>/<short-desc>` | Linear issue work | `met-40/phase-0-specs` |
| `docs/<short-desc>` | Documentation changes | `docs/skill-spec-update` |
| `release/v<version>` | Release preparation | `release/v0.1.0` |

### Rules

1. **Never commit directly to `main`**. All changes go through pull requests.
2. Feature branches are created from `main` and merged back via PR.
3. Branches are deleted after merge.
4. Rebase before merge to keep linear history (no merge commits).

### Pull Request Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Reviewers | At least 1 approval from directory owner |
| Tests | All existing tests pass; new code includes tests |
| Lint | `ruff check .` passes (Python) or `eslint` passes (TypeScript) |
| Types | `mypy .` passes (Python, strict mode) or `tsc --noEmit` (TypeScript) |
| Docs | Public API changes include docstring updates |
| Linear | PR description references Linear issue (e.g., "Closes MET-42") |

## 6. Spec Change Process

Specification documents (`docs/*.md`) are living documents. Changes follow an RFC process:

### Process

1. **Propose**: Create a Linear issue with label `RFC` describing the change and rationale.
2. **Discuss**: Team reviews the issue. Comments and alternatives are discussed.
3. **Decide**: Issue author updates the proposal based on feedback. A team member approves.
4. **Implement**: Author creates a PR with the spec change. PR references the RFC issue.
5. **Merge**: PR is reviewed and merged. RFC issue is closed.

### Rules

- Spec changes that affect multiple documents must update all affected docs in the same PR.
- Breaking changes to the Twin schema, Skill spec, or MCP spec require ADR (Architecture Decision Record).
- ADRs are numbered sequentially (ADR-001, ADR-002, ...) and stored in `docs/adr/`.

## 7. Coding Standards

### Python (Platform Core)

| Tool | Configuration | Enforcement |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Ruff** | `ruff.toml` in repo root | CI check, pre-commit hook |
| **mypy** | Strict mode (`--strict`) | CI check |
| **Pydantic** | v2 with `model_config = ConfigDict(strict=True)` where appropriate | Runtime validation |
| **pytest** | Async tests with `pytest-asyncio` | CI required |
| **structlog** | Structured JSON logging | Required for all modules |

#### Python Style Rules

- **Type hints**: All function signatures must have type annotations.
- **Docstrings**: All public classes and functions must have docstrings (Google style).
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports. No wildcard imports.
- **Async**: Use `async`/`await` for all I/O operations.
- **Models**: Use Pydantic `BaseModel` for all data structures that cross module boundaries.
- **Errors**: Use domain-specific exception classes, not bare `Exception`.
- **Tests**: Minimum 80% coverage for new code. Use `pytest.mark.asyncio` for async tests.

### Node.js / TypeScript (CLI Only)

| Tool | Configuration | Enforcement |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **TypeScript** | Strict mode (`strict: true` in `tsconfig.json`) | CI check |
| **ESLint** | `eslint.config.js` in `cli/` | CI check, pre-commit hook |
| **Prettier** | `.prettierrc` in `cli/` | CI check, pre-commit hook |
| **Jest** | Test runner for CLI commands | CI required |

#### TypeScript Style Rules

- **Strict mode**: No `any` types. Explicit return types on exported functions.
- **Naming**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for types/classes.
- **Imports**: ES module imports. No `require()`.

### Epic Structure

| Epic | Scope | Phase |
|------|-------|-------|
| MET-40 | Phase 0: Specification documents | Phase 0 |
| MET-5 | Digital Twin Core | Phase 1 |
| MET-6 | Skill System | Phase 1 |
| MET-7 | MCP Infrastructure | Phase 1-2 |
| MET-8 | Mechanical Agent (first vertical) | Phase 1 |

## 9. Release Process

### Versioning

MetaForge follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **v0.x.y**: Pre-1.0 development. Minor bumps may include breaking changes.
- **v1.0.0**: First stable release (end of Phase 3).

### Phase Gates

Each phase version increment requires:

| Gate | Requirement |
|------|------------|
| All epics for the phase are Done | Linear epic status = Done |
| Test coverage ≥ 80% | CI coverage report |
| All P0/P1 bugs resolved | No open Critical/High bugs |
| Spec documents up to date | docs/ matches implementation |
| CHANGELOG.md updated | Summarizes changes since last release |
| Release branch created | `release/v<version>` branch |
| Tag created | `v<version>` tag on merge to main |

### Release Steps

1. Create release branch: `release/v0.1.0` from `main`.
2. Update version numbers in `pyproject.toml` and `cli/package.json`.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. Create PR to `main`.
5. After merge, tag: `git tag v0.1.0`.
6. Push tag: `git push origin v0.1.0`.
7. Create GitHub Release from tag with changelog contents.
