## 9. Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| LLM quality degrades for domain tasks | High | Medium | Skill system is deterministic — LLM only selects skills, doesn't execute logic. Multi-provider support via PydanticAI. |
| CalculiX/FreeCAD container performance | Medium | Medium | Warm container pool, timeout tuning, async execution. |
| Neo4j scaling limits for large designs | Medium | Low | Index strategy, query optimization, sharding plan for Phase 3. |
| Temporal complexity for simple workflows | Low | Medium | Simple workflows bypass Temporal and run inline. |
| KiCad write adapter reliability | High | Medium | Extensive validation, snapshot/rollback, human review gate. |
| Team ramp-up on PydanticAI + Temporal | Medium | Medium | ADR-001 includes spike/POC. Training budget allocated. |
| Scope creep in Phase 1 | High | High | Strict 6-7 agent limit. No Phase 2 features in Phase 1. Weekly scope reviews. |
| LLM API cost overruns | Medium | Medium | Token budgets per skill, caching, local model fallback investigation. |
| Docker security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Base image scanning, no network access, read-only mounts, regular updates. |
