"""Public ``KnowledgeService`` interface for the L1 knowledge layer.

Defines the framework-agnostic contract that all knowledge backends
(LightRAG, LlamaIndex, custom) must satisfy. Per ADR-008, the interface
is the swap-out clause: callers depend on this Protocol, never on the
concrete implementation.

The dataclasses (``IngestResult``, ``SearchHit``) are deliberately plain
``@dataclass`` rather than Pydantic models so the public contract stays
free of any Pydantic-version coupling and is trivially constructible
from any backend.
