# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What Is MetaForge

MetaForge is a **local-first control plane** that turns human intent into reviewable, manufacturable hardware deliverables. It orchestrates specialist AI agents that interface with real engineering tools (KiCad, FreeCAD, CalculiX, SPICE) to produce schematics, BOMs, PCB layouts, firmware scaffolds, manufacturing files, and test plans.

**Prime Rule**: If it can't be versioned, reviewed, and built — MetaForge doesn't output it.

## Documentation: Two Sources of Truth

Architecture documentation lives in **two places**, split by tense — what is built vs. what is planned. Consult the right one for the task:

### Live architecture — this repo's `docs/`

The **`docs/`** directory in *this* repo documents the architecture **as implemented**. This is the source of truth for how the system actually works today. It is published as a MkDocs Material site on GitHub Pages at **https://fidelodok.github.io/MetaForge/** (auto-deployed by `.github/workflows/docs.yml` on every push to `main` that touches `docs/`). Key references:

- **Overview**: `docs/architecture.md` — system architecture as built
- **Harness**: `docs/architecture/robust-harness-design.md` — the agent harness (ReAct loop, providers, tools, gates)
- **Context engineering**: `docs/architecture/context-engineering.md`
- **MCP protocol**: `docs/mcp_spec.md` — wire protocol + tool communication
- **Capability matrix**: `docs/capability-matrix.md` — tool catalog + Phase-1 limits
- **Skill / Twin specs**: `docs/skill_spec.md`, `docs/twin_schema.md`
- **Session capture**: `docs/session-capture.md`

When documenting or reasoning about **current behavior**, use `docs/` — and keep it accurate, since the docs CI builds `--strict` (broken links / warnings fail the build).

**Update documentation before merge.** Any change that alters user-facing behavior, gateway routes, schemas, CLI commands, or architecture must land its `docs/` update **in the same PR** — never as a follow-up. Specifically:

- **Gateway API**: the reference at `docs/reference/gateway-api.md` renders `docs/reference/openapi.json`, which is generated from the live app. When you change a route or response schema, run `python scripts/gen_openapi.py` and commit the regenerated spec so the published reference can't drift.
- **CLI / behavior / architecture**: update the relevant `docs/` page (e.g. `cli-reference.md`, `architecture.md`, `capability-matrix.md`) alongside the code.
- Verify locally with `mkdocs build --strict` before opening the PR — this is exactly what CI runs, and it fails on broken links or warnings.

### Future plans — the MetaForge-Planner repo

The **MetaForge-Planner** repo (`FidelOdok/MetaForge-Planner`) is the source of truth for **forward-looking** plans, specifications, and vision — what we intend to build, not what exists yet:

- **Architecture (planned)**: `docs/architecture/` — system vision, orchestrator design, technical specs
- **Repository Structure**: `docs/architecture/repository-structure.md` — canonical monorepo layout
- **Framework**: `docs/FRAMEWORK_MAPPING.md` — 25-discipline taxonomy with phase-by-phase implementation
- **Roadmap**: `docs/roadmap.md` and `docs/architecture/mvp-roadmap.md` — phased delivery plan
- **Agent specs**: `docs/agents/` — per-agent design documents
- **Tool catalog**: `TOOLS_INTEGRATION_CATALOG.md` — all external tool integrations
- **Vision**: `VISION.md` — project principles and non-goals

When **planning new features or making architectural decisions**, fetch the relevant docs from `FidelOdok/MetaForge-Planner` using GitHub tools before implementing. Do not invent architecture — follow what's specified there. Once a plan is built, reflect the implemented reality in this repo's `docs/`.

### Compounding knowledge — this repo's `wiki/`

The **`wiki/`** directory is a third, distinct source: not curated docs, not forward plans, but a git-tracked, agent-maintained knowledge base of durable operational facts — gotchas, drift between docs and reality, "look here not there" corrections — following Andrej Karpathy's "LLM wiki" pattern. This CLAUDE.md section *is* the schema Karpathy's pattern calls for: the file that tells you how the wiki is structured and what to do with it. Start at `wiki/README.md` for the full pattern explanation, `wiki/index.md` for the page catalog, `wiki/log.md` for the ingest history.

- `wiki/` is not `docs/`: it's not published, not subject to `mkdocs build --strict`, and has no nav to maintain. One page per entity/concept, `kebab-case.md`, `---\nupdated: YYYY-MM-DD\n---` frontmatter on every page, cross-linked with relative markdown links.
- **Ingest** — when you learn something durable and non-obvious (a gotcha, a piece of docs-vs-reality drift, a "look here not there" correction), write or update a page **in the same session**, update `wiki/index.md`, and append an entry to `wiki/log.md` (`## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | <title>`). Don't wait to be asked.
- **Query** — before working in an unfamiliar part of the repo, read `wiki/index.md` first. If your answer to a question is worth keeping — a root-cause writeup, a comparison, a synthesis — file it back into the wiki as a new page instead of letting it evaporate into chat history; log it as `query`.
- **Lint** — periodically (or when something feels off), check for contradictions between pages, claims a newer page has superseded, orphan pages nothing links to, concepts mentioned repeatedly with no page of their own, and stale `updated:` dates. Fix what you find and log the pass as `lint`.

## Project & Task Management (Linear)

All project tracking lives in **Linear** under the **MetaForge** team:

- **Project**: "MetaForge Platform v1.0" (ID: `9ae4e6e0-3f38-4fea-be87-0876f87a83fd`)
- **Team**: MetaForge (ID: `e30e7c0e-d9a5-44af-9cb0-5745aa3dc78a`)

### Workflow

1. **Before starting work**: Check Linear for the relevant issue/epic using `list_issues` or `get_issue`
2. **When starting an issue**: Update its status from Backlog to In Progress
3. **When done**: Update status to Done and add a comment with what was implemented
4. **New work discovered**: Create a Linear issue under the appropriate epic before implementing

### Epic Structure (MET-5 through MET-10, MET-40)

| Epic | Scope | Phase |
|------|-------|-------|
| MET-40: Phase 0 Specs | Finalize all specification documents before dev | Phase 0 |
| MET-5: Digital Twin Core | Graph engine, versioning, constraints, Twin API | Phase 1 |
| MET-6: Skill System | Registry, loader, schema validator, MCP bridge | Phase 1 |
| MET-7: MCP Infrastructure | Client, wire protocol, tool registry, adapters | Phase 1-2 |
| MET-8: Mechanical Agent | Stress validation, meshing, tolerances (first vertical) | Phase 1 |
| MET-9: Electronics Agent | ERC, DRC, power budget, KiCad adapter | Phase 2 |
| MET-10: Assistant Layer | IDE extensions, approval workflow, CLI | Phase 2-3 |

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Primary Language | Python 3.11+ (Gateway, Agents, Twin, Skills, MCP, CLI) |
| Dashboard | TypeScript / React (`dashboard/`) |
| CLI Libraries | argparse + httpx (`cli/forge_cli/`) |
| Gateway | FastAPI + Uvicorn |
| Agent Framework | PydanticAI + Temporal (ADR-001) |
| LLM Providers | `openai` + `anthropic` SDKs via unified abstraction |
| Validation | Pydantic v2 |
| Workflow Engine | Temporal (Python SDK) |
| Graph Database | Neo4j |
| Event Bus | Apache Kafka |
| Observability | OpenTelemetry + structlog + Prometheus + Grafana |

## Dual-Mode Operation

MetaForge supports two operational modes:

- **Assistant Mode** (default): Human edits design files directly; MetaForge validates post-edit and flags issues. Read-only by default — explicit approval required for writes.
- **Autonomous Mode**: AI agents drive the design loop (propose → validate → refine). Human reviews and approves at gate checkpoints.

## Artifacts & Scratch Deliverables

**Never publish artifacts to `https://claude.ai/code/artifact/`.** When you build an artifact-style deliverable (architecture briefings, visual reports, standalone HTML/Markdown pages), do **not** use the hosted Artifact/publish tool. Instead write the file into the repo's gitignored **`.artifacts/`** directory as a temporary local file and share that local path. These are scratch outputs: they are ignored by `.gitignore` and **must never be committed** or land in git history.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
# Platform core + CLI (Python)
pip install -e ".[dev]"          # Install in dev mode
pytest                           # Run tests
ruff check .                     # Lint
mypy .                           # Type check

# CLI invocation
python -m cli.forge_cli --help   # See available subcommands

# Dashboard (TypeScript / React)
cd dashboard && npm install
npm run dev                      # Vite dev server
npm run build                    # Production build
```

The CLI lives at `cli/forge_cli/` (argparse-based, see `main.py`).
There is no `forge` binary in `[project.scripts]` yet — invoke via
`python -m cli.forge_cli`. See [`docs/cli-reference.md`](docs/cli-reference.md)
for the full command catalog.

## Git Workflow

**Never commit directly to `main`.** All changes follow this workflow:

1. **Branch** — Create a feature branch from `main` (e.g., `feat/met-15-twin-api`)
2. **Implement** — Commit changes to the feature branch
3. **Test branch** — Run `pytest`, `ruff check .`, `mypy .` on the branch
4. **Update docs** — Land any required `docs/` updates **in the same PR** (see [Update documentation before merge](#documentation-two-sources-of-truth)); verify with `mkdocs build --strict`
5. **Pull request** — Open a PR to `main` with a summary of changes
6. **Merge** — Merge the PR into `main` (squash or merge commit)
7. **Test main** — Verify `main` passes all checks after merge

## Commit Convention

Use **Conventional Commits** format:

```
type(scope): description
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `style`, `perf`, `build`

**Scope** (optional): module name — `twin-core`, `skill-system`, `mcp`, `cli`, `gateway`, `orchestrator`

**Examples**:
```
feat(twin-core): implement Twin API facade
fix(skill-system): handle missing definition.json gracefully
docs: update twin_schema.md to v0.2
test(constraint-engine): add cross-domain validation tests
chore: add .gitignore
```

## Platform Source Repository Structure (Modular Monorepo)

This repo follows the canonical layout defined in `FidelOdok/MetaForge-Planner` at `docs/architecture/repository-structure.md`. Each top-level directory maps to an architectural layer:

**Note**: The platform core, agents, and CLI are all Python (`.py`). Only the dashboard (`dashboard/`) uses TypeScript (`.ts`/`.tsx`).

## User Project Structure (What MetaForge Manages)

When a user runs `forge setup`, MetaForge creates this structure for their hardware project:

```
project/
├── PRD.md                      # Human intent (product requirements)
├── constraints.json            # Design rules and constraints
├── decisions.md                # Design decisions log
├── eda/kicad/                  # Schematic + PCB files
├── bom/                        # BOM, alternates, costing
├── firmware/src/               # Firmware source + pinmap.json
├── manufacturing/              # Gerbers, pick & place
├── tests/bringup.md            # Bring-up checklists
└── .forge/
    ├── sessions/               # Agent session records
    └── traces/                 # Execution traces
```

## Architecture Overview

```
Human Intent (PRD, constraints)
         |
    CLI / IDE Assistant
         |
    Gateway Service (HTTP/WebSocket — the "front door")
         |
    Orchestrator (coordination engine — the "brain")
         |
    Domain Agents (specialist per discipline)
         |
    Skill System (atomic, schema-validated units of expertise)
         |
    MCP Protocol Layer (tool access — never direct invocation)
         |
    Tool Adapters (KiCad, FreeCAD, CalculiX, SPICE — containerized)
         |
    Digital Twin (Digital Thread — single source of design truth)
```

Key architectural rules:
- **Agents never call tools directly** — all tool access goes through MCP protocol
- **Digital Twin owns all state** — agents read from and propose changes to the Twin
- **Human-in-the-loop** — read-only by default, explicit approval required for writes
- **Skills are the atomic unit** — deterministic, schema-validated, independently testable
- **Git-native** — everything versioned, diffed, reviewable

## Phase Scope (Do Not Conflate)

- **Phase 1 (v0.1-0.3)**: 6-7 specialist agents, 6-7 core disciplines. Electronics-heavy products (IoT, drones, embedded). KiCad read-only (ERC/DRC/BOM/Gerber export). Timeline: 6 months total (3-4 months core dev + 1-2 months testing/docs).
- **Phase 2 (v0.4-0.6)**: 19 total agents, 19 disciplines. KiCad write capabilities. Industrial Design + Prototyping added.
- **Phase 3 (v0.7-1.0)**: 25 total agents, all 25 disciplines.

## Terminology

- **Gateway Service**: HTTP/WebSocket API server (the "front door")
- **Orchestrator**: Coordination engine within Gateway (the "brain")
- **Skill**: Atomic unit of domain expertise (deterministic, schema-validated)
- **Digital Twin**: WorkProduct graph that owns all design state
- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol — the wire protocol for tool access
- **Domain Agent**: Specialist agent for one engineering discipline (1:1 ratio)

## Testing Requirements

**Every module must have tests.** MetaForge uses a 12-level testing taxonomy — see [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md) for the full taxonomy, per-level tooling, and coverage status.

For Phase 1, the minimum bar per module is:

- **Static Analysis (Level 1)**: `ruff check` and `mypy --strict` pass with zero errors
- **Unit Tests (Level 2)**: all public functions exercised in isolation via `pytest tests/unit/`
- **Component Tests (Level 3)**: key module entry points tested with in-memory doubles (`InMemoryTwinAPI`, `InMemoryMcpBridge`)
- **Integration Tests (Level 5)**: cross-module wiring verified via `pytest tests/integration/`
- **E2E / System Tests (Level 8)**: at least one full vertical test per agent in `pytest tests/e2e/`

Levels 4, 9, 10, 11, and 12 (Contract, Performance, Security, Acceptance, Chaos) are Phase 2+ scope.

## Observability Requirements

**Every module must include observability.** MetaForge uses a 7-level observability taxonomy. When creating or modifying any Python module, instrument the following levels:

1. **Logs (Level 1)** — structured logging via `structlog`: `logger = structlog.get_logger(__name__)` — log key operations with keyword arguments. Implementation: `observability/logging.py` (`configure_logging`, `add_trace_context`).

2. **Metrics (Level 2)** — via `observability.metrics`: register counters, histograms, and gauges in `MetricsRegistry` for throughput, latency, and error rates. Implementation: `observability/metrics.py` (`MetricDefinition`, `MetricsRegistry`).

3. **Traces (Level 3)** — distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry: `tracer = get_tracer("module.name")` from `observability.tracing` — wrap key operations with `tracer.start_as_current_span()`, set relevant attributes. Call `span.record_exception(exc)` in except blocks. Implementation: `observability/tracing.py` (`get_tracer`, `NoOpTracer` fallback).

4. **Profiling (Level 4)** — CPU/memory profiling via Pyroscope. Captured at the process level automatically — module authors do not need to add instrumentation. To inspect: use `mcp__grafana__query_pyroscope` or the Grafana Pyroscope datasource.

5. **Alerting (Level 5)** — when writing new metrics, add corresponding alert rules to `observability/alerting/rules.yaml` for anomalous values (error rate spikes, latency SLO breaches). Do not create ad-hoc Grafana alerts — all alert rules must be version-controlled in `alerting/`.

6. **Synthetic Monitoring (Level 6)** — proactive fake requests to verify the system is alive. Implemented via the `dashboard-tester` agent (`.claude/agents/dashboard-tester.agent.md`) and the `/test-dashboard` command. Not yet integrated as a polling service in CI.

7. **RUM / Real User Monitoring (Level 7)** — experience as seen by actual users. In progress (MET-288). Front-end concern only — no per-module Python instrumentation required.

Follow existing patterns in `observability/tracing.py` (get_tracer, NoOpTracer fallback) and `observability/metrics.py` (MetricDefinition, MetricsRegistry). The system degrades gracefully without the OTel SDK installed.

## Observability Stack (Grafana)

The dev environment includes a full observability stack accessible via Grafana MCP:

| Datasource | UID | Purpose |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| Prometheus | `PBFA97CFB590B2093` | Metrics (HTTP latency, error rates, agent task counters) |
| Loki | `loki` | Structured logs (all gateway/agent logs via OTel) |
| Tempo | `P214B5B846CF3925F` | Distributed traces (spans across gateway → orchestrator → agent → skill) |

### Log Labels

Loki logs are labeled with `service_name` (currently `metaforge-gateway`) and `deployment_environment` (`docker`). Each log entry includes OTel context: `trace_id`, `span_id`, `scope_name` (logger), `severity_text`, and `code_file_path`.

### Custom Agents & Commands

| Agent / Command | File | Purpose |
|----------------|------|---------|
| `dashboard-tester` | `.claude/agents/dashboard-tester.agent.md` | E2E dashboard testing via Playwright + Grafana observability validation |
| `bug-hunter` | `.claude/agents/bug-hunter.agent.md` | Scans Grafana for errors/anomalies, triages, deduplicates against Linear, files bugs |
| `/test-dashboard` | `.claude/commands/test-dashboard.md` | Launch dashboard-tester agent with scenario or natural language |
| `/bug-hunt` | `.claude/commands/bug-hunt.md` | Launch bug-hunter agent — scan last 1h (default), custom window, or focused search |

### Bug Hunt Workflow

`/bug-hunt` runs a 5-phase pipeline:

1. **Pre-flight** — verify Grafana datasources are reachable
2. **Scan** — Loki error logs, error patterns, Prometheus error rates, latency anomalies, firing alerts
3. **Triage** — classify severity, enrich with trace context + source code, generate Grafana deeplinks, deduplicate against Linear
4. **Report** — structured findings with code context and Grafana links
5. **File** — create Linear issues (only after user approval)

Scoped to **gateway** and **dashboard** services only. Never auto-files bugs without user confirmation.

## Agent Session Capture (MET-492)

When an external agent (this CLI, Cursor, …) drives MetaForge over MCP, its work is captured into the digital thread's `/sessions` so reasoning + actions are reviewable. Three layers:

- **Layer A — server-side auto-capture (MET-496)**: the MCP sidecar records every tool call as an `action` event into an agent session. Enforced, zero cooperation; enabled via `--capture-sessions` on the dev `mcp-http`. Works for any client.
- **Layer B — client capture core + hooks (MET-497)**: `tools/session_capture/` (`metaforge-capture`, stdlib+httpx, no MetaForge imports) pushes `thought`/`action`/`decision` events to `/v1/sessions`. The checked-in Claude Code adapter (`tools/session_capture/claude_code_adapter.py`, wired via `.claude/settings.json`) captures the model's *reasoning* from the transcript on `Stop`, actions on `PostToolUse`, and completes on `SessionEnd`. Per-client adapters (Cursor/OpenCode/Codex) + a transcript-tailer fallback are MET-498. Kill-switch: `METAFORGE_SESSION_CAPTURE=off`.
- **Layer C — explicit tools (MET-494/495)**: call `session.start` / `session.log_event` (`type=decision` for design choices) / `session.complete`, and `twin.record_decision` to persist a typed ADR. `session.start` takes over the Layer-A binding so auto-actions attach to your session.

Store is Postgres (`agent_sessions` / `agent_session_events`), shared by the gateway and sidecar via `DATABASE_URL` (MET-493). Capture is always best-effort — it never fails or blocks a tool call.

## Critical Constraints

1. Never claim Phase 1 has KiCad schematic generation (that's Phase 2 write capability)
2. Phase 1 is 6-7 disciplines, not 12 — 1:1 agent-to-discipline ratio
3. Phase 1 timeline is "6 months total" not "3-4 months"
4. MetaForge uses PydanticAI + Temporal for agent orchestration (ADR-001)
5. All tool adapters run in Docker containers
6. The first end-to-end vertical is the Mechanical Agent (MET-8): CAD model -> FEA -> Digital Twin update
